/**
 * Bearguard settings backup.
 *
 * Observed live after losing his configuration twice in one evening: "we can't have this
 * keep happening."
 *
 * Why it happens: Bearguard keeps SQLite in WAL mode, so recent writes live in frostguard.db-wal
 * until a checkpoint folds them into frostguard.db. Killing the process hard (which a rebuild
 * cycle does constantly) can leave that WAL unmerged, and the settings written since the last
 * checkpoint are effectively gone. The 4MB WAL sitting next to a 151KB database was the tell.
 *
 * What this does, in order:
 *   1. Checkpoints the WAL into the main database, so nothing is stranded.
 *   2. Copies the whole database to a timestamped file under settings-backups/.
 *   3. Writes a plain-text dump of every config row, so a wipe can be repaired key-by-key
 *      without swapping the entire database and losing whatever came after.
 *   4. Prunes to the newest RETAIN copies.
 *
 * Safe to run while Bearguard is up: the checkpoint is a normal SQLite operation and the copy is
 * taken through the sqlite3 backup API rather than a raw file copy, so it cannot catch a
 * half-written page.
 *
 * Usage:  node backup-settings.js
