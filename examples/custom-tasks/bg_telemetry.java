/**
 * Bearguard telemetry: samples the top HUD on a schedule and appends the result
 * to a JSON history the Whiteout dashboard reads.
 *
 * <p>This exists because the external Node scraper that used to do this drove
 * ADB itself, so it could not run while the bot was running — the two fought
 * over the same device. Running the capture as a task inside the bot's own
 * queue removes that conflict by construction, and inherits the engine's
 * screen-verification and retry behaviour for free.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately additive: a new file under custom_tasks/, no upstream source
 * touched, so merges from Shederator/wosbot stay clean.
