@echo off
REM Paths corrected after the toolchain moved out of OneDrive. Maven and the
REM bundled Temurin JDK both live under C:\Frostguard-tools now; the old C:\apache-maven-3.9.12
REM path never existed on this machine, so `call mvn` below failed with "not recognized". JAVA_HOME
REM is set explicitly too, because there is no system-wide Java install for mvn to fall back on.
REM
REM Updated for the upstream module restructure (fg-app -> modules/desktop,
REM packaged via packaging/desktop). The old fg-app\target\frostguard-*.jar path is gone -- the real
REM launchable jar + lib/ classpath now live under packaging\desktop\target\input\, produced by the
REM new packaging module's dependency-copy step, not modules/desktop's own package phase.

REM This used to be taskkill /F on java.exe + javaw.exe. A hard kill strands writes in
REM frostguard.db-wal, which is how settings were lost twice, and it also killed every OTHER Java
REM process on the machine including a dev instance. stop-bearguard.ps1 backs up, asks the window
REM to close, and confirms it went; if it will not close we abort rather than build against a
REM running instance holding the jars.
