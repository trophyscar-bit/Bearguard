/**
 * Reads every on-screen countdown and records it, without performing any activity.

 * <p>matt, 2026-08-08, on watching the bot start: <em>"it's just launching into actually trying
 * to do tasks... It's not taking its time and refreshing all of the timers. It's just blindly
 * trying to rush through every task it has. That's incorrect. That's not the order of operations
 * you and I talked about."</em> He was right, and this is the missing phase.</p>
 *
 * <p>The distinction that matters: the earlier "startup rescan" forced every task due, which made
 * each routine run its <em>whole workload</em> to arrive at a new timer. This reads the timers
 * directly and touches nothing else, so the bot learns what is due before deciding what to do.
 * Once the sweep has run, ordinary dispatch only fires what is genuinely due — a camp with two
 * hours left is simply known about, not visited.</p>
 *
 * <p>Runs first at startup and again every {@link ConfigurationKeyEnum#TIMER_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MINUTES_INT}
 * minutes, the repeat doubling as drift detection against what was recorded earlier.</p>
