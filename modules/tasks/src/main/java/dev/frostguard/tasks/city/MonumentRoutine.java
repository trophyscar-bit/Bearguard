/**
 * Task responsible for the Monument / "Explore the World" Atlas feature: claiming
 * ready milestone rewards and cracking open owned Scene Fragment Packs from the
 * shared Fragment Backpack.
 *
 * <p>
 * matt/2026-08-14: the original {@code LaunchPoint.HOME}-then-pan-search approach
 * (see the old header below) turned out to be unreliable in practice -- camera pan
 * position drifts run to run depending on whatever the prior task left it at, so the
 * badge was often not where the pan sweep expected. Real fix, live-verified on the
 * Testing profile before merging here: anchor off Lancer Camp instead (a fixed
 * building, always reachable the same way via the left-menu queue list), then a
 * single confirmed 300px right swipe brings Monument's badge into view every time.
 * See {@link #findAndOpenBadgeViaLancer()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Flow (live-verified 2026-08-14, screenshot-confirmed at every step):</b>
 * <pre>
 * Home -> open left-menu City section -> tap Lancer row -> tap the camp building
 * -> wait 5s -> swipe right 300px -> template-search the reward badge, tap it,
 * VERIFY it's no longer detectable (confirms something actually opened, instead of
 * assuming) -> claim any ready rows -> X close -> back arrow -> Tundra Albums hub
 * -> Fragment Backpack (bottom-right of the hub) -> open every owned pack (rescanning
 * from scratch after each open, since the panel reflows) -> close -> milestone chest
 * track -> back arrow -> Home, badge cleared.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Fragment Backpack bug fixed 2026-08-14:</b> this used to fire one screen too
 * early, at a coordinate (470,1275) that doesn't correspond to a real button on the
 * screen the badge tap actually leads to -- it always missed, read garbled OCR text,
 * and silently skipped the whole backpack pass every single run. Moved to fire AFTER
 * the back-arrow (on the real Tundra Albums hub) at the hub's own Fragment Backpack
 * button (628,1197) -- live-verified hand-driven, screenshot-confirmed: opened 2 real
 * packs (General Album, Nature's Strength), rewards actually landed (fragment count
 * advanced 827/1347 -> 846/1347), panel reflow after each open behaved exactly as the
 * candidate-rescan logic below expects.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Alliance Trade deliberately NOT run automatically (matt's call, 2026-08-14):</b>
 * the request/send logic below is real and was live-verified working correctly (Ally
 * Requests skip owned:1 rows and only send genuine duplicates, confirmed against a
 * live panel) -- but matt wants to handle Alliance Trade manually for now, so
 * {@code execute()} no longer calls it. Left in place, unused, for a future re-enable
 * rather than deleted.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Known gaps (not built):</b> Ally Requests list is only scanned for rows already
 * visible on open (no deep-scroll dedup), matching the same scroll-list limitation
 * already known in ChatCaptureRoutine.

     * presses, and only falls back to a cautious single back-press-and-recheck loop
     * when the screen is genuinely unrecognized. Still try the known stray-panel
