/**
 * Task responsible for the Monument / "Explore the World" Atlas feature: claiming
 * ready milestone rewards and cracking open owned Scene Fragment Packs from the
 * shared Fragment Backpack.
 *
 * <p>
 * The original {@code LaunchPoint.HOME}-then-pan-search approach
 * (see the old header below) turned out to be unreliable in practice -- camera pan
 * position drifts run to run depending on whatever the prior task left it at, so the
 * badge was often not where the pan sweep expected. Real fix, live-verified on the
 * Testing profile before merging here: anchor off Lancer Camp instead (a fixed
 * building, always reachable the same way via the left-menu queue list), then a
 * single confirmed 300px right swipe brings Monument into view every time.
 * See {@link #findAndOpenBadgeViaLancer()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Even that swipe still fell back into a full camera-pan sweep
 * whenever a template search for the reward badge came up empty right after landing
 * -- "it pans to the right of lancer, you see monument, then it just starts
 * scrolling around." The 8-direction pan-fallback (the actual "scrolling around")
 * is removed entirely. A first attempt to also drop the template search itself in
 * favor of a fixed-pixel tap was WRONG -- that coordinate was guessed from an old
 * debug frame instead of a confirmed one, and it mis-tapped the Archer Camp instead
 * of Monument. Fixed for real this time: {@link #MONUMENT_BADGE_TAP_POINT} is
 * verified against 3 real screenshots (shop-debug/monument_find.png,
 * monument_check2.png, monument_check3.png) all showing the scroll-with-a-feather
 * badge in the identical spot after this exact swipe, and confirmed the
 * reference frame live before this landed. No template search, no pan fallback.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Flow:</b>
 * <pre>
 * Home -> open left-menu City section -> tap Lancer row -> tap the camp building
 * -> wait 5s -> swipe right 300px -> tap the fixed badge point, VERIFY the badge
 * is no longer detectable (confirms something actually opened, instead of
 * assuming) -> claim any ready rows -> X close -> back arrow -> Tundra Albums hub
 * -> Fragment Backpack (bottom-right of the hub) -> open every owned pack (rescanning
 * from scratch after each open, since the panel reflows) -> close -> milestone chest
 * track -> back arrow -> Home, badge cleared.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Fragment Backpack bug fixed 2026-08-14:</b> this used to fire one screen too
 * early, at a coordinate (470,1275) that doesn't correspond to a real button on the
 * screen the badge tap actually leads to -- it always missed, read garbled OCR text,
 * and silently skipped the whole backpack pass every single run. Moved to fire AFTER
 * the back-arrow (on the real Tundra Albums hub) at the hub's own Fragment Backpack
 * button (628,1197) -- live-verified hand-driven, screenshot-confirmed: opened 2 real
 * packs (General Album, Nature's Strength), rewards actually landed (fragment count
 * advanced 827/1347 -> 846/1347), panel reflow after each open behaved exactly as the
 * candidate-rescan logic below expects.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Alliance Trade deliberately NOT run automatically (by design):</b>
 * the request/send logic below is real and was live-verified working correctly (Ally
 * Requests skip owned:1 rows and only send genuine duplicates, confirmed against a
 * live panel) -- but the intent is to handle Alliance Trade manually for now, so
 * {@code execute()} no longer calls it. Left in place, unused, for a future re-enable
 * rather than deleted.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Known gaps (not built):</b> Ally Requests list is only scanned for rows already
 * visible on open (no deep-scroll dedup), matching the same scroll-list limitation
 * already known in ChatCaptureRoutine.
