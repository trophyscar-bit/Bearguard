    // scores 33.4, 33.4, 37.9 and 38.5, so 60 sits about twenty points clear of the loudest noise
    // and about fourteen below the dimmest real sighting. Four attempts 400ms apart spans roughly

    // Real live evidence (two logged misses at 40.7 and 50.6, different scores on
    // a supposedly-static template) plus live observation -- "the icon in the game dances back
    // and forth" -- points at the same problem LifeEssenceRoutine already hit and documented: a
    // claimable badge that bounces/animates never settles into one shape/position, so no single
    // correlation score is reliable, and even that badge's own clean self-match capped at ~0.84
    // (84). Life Essence's fix was color-blob detection; Monument doesn't need that rebuild because
    // it already has two independent real backstops a plain low-confidence match doesn't: the
    // Events-tab landing check, and the post-tap "is the badge still detectable" verification. Per
    // By design ("what's really worse case? it gets into Monument and nothing is there to do? I
    // don't think there's a downside") -- dropped to 30, comfortably under the lowest logged miss
    // (40.7) so a low point in the bounce cycle still clears it, while still requiring real
    // correlation (not near-zero) so an unrelated screen element can't match by coincidence during
    // the full-frame scan. Do not reuse for other templates; revisit if real evidence says otherwise.
    // Threshold was 30 because MONUMENT_REWARD_BADGE pointed at the WRONG ASSET --
    // /templates/exploration/exploreTheWorldIcon.png, the Explore-the-World scroll-and-quill, which
    // is not Monument's badge and never was. (That's the "scroll+feather" every comment in this file
    // describes; the comments were faithfully describing the wrong picture.) Nothing on screen could
    // ever match it, so the threshold had been dragged down to 30 until noise started "matching",
    // and the routine then tapped that noise -- landing on the Events rail, or on blank snow.
    //
    // Measured against a live frame captured at the moment of failure:
    //     exploreTheWorldIcon (old)  43.68%  @(366,366)   <- noise, nowhere near the badge
    //     monumentRewardBadge (new) 100.00%  @(389,537)   <- the actual badge
    // The real badge is a white bubble holding a gold puzzle piece with a blue swap arrow, sitting
    // above the Monument spire. It's now cropped from that frame and wired up in
    // templates.properties, so a real threshold works again.
    //
    // 60 sits far above the measured noise floor (43-52 across every stale template tried on that
    // frame) and far below a genuine hit. Not set higher: the 100% above is inflated by the template
    // having been cropped from this exact frame, so real matches on other frames will score lower.

     *
     * <p>Threshold 45, measured against live captures after the template was recut from the

     * and one that is absent scores 23-32%, a margin wide enough that the threshold stops being a
     * tuning exercise. 45 sits in that gap: high enough to reject an empty city view, low enough to
     * still locate a Lighthouse the UI banner is partly covering, which measured 65%.
     *
     * <p>The old 70 was set against the lamp template, whose real matches (69%) were
     * indistinguishable from its noise (68%). No threshold could have worked there -- the template
     * had to change, not the number.
