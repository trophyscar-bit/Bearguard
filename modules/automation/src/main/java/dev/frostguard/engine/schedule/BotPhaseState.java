/**
 * A short-lived phase label describing what the bot is doing right now.
 *
 * <p>The status readout jumped from "Starting up" to "Active" within a couple
 * of seconds, which told him nothing about the phase he actually cares about — the point where
 * the bot is reading every countdown off the screen before it acts. This carries that phase up
 * to the UI so the label reflects the work rather than just the run state.</p>
 *
 * <p>Deliberately a plain static holder rather than a listener chain: the launcher already polls
 * once a second to refresh uptime, so it can read this on the same tick, and a phase that fails
 * to clear degrades to the ordinary "Active" label rather than wedging anything.</p>
