/**
 * Single shared implementation of the "quit game?" confirmation-dialog recovery, so every Back
 * press in the codebase gets the same protection instead of each call site inventing its own.
 *
 * <p>The review flagged two real gaps in the original version of this guard (which
 * lived only in {@code NavigationHelper}): (1) the dialog was checked for immediately after the
 * ADB Back command with no settle delay, so a dialog that animates in a beat late was missed, and
 * (2) several direct {@code EmulatorController.pressBack(...)} call sites across the codebase
 * (AllianceHelper, CharacterSwitchHelper, IntelScreenHelper, StaminaHelper,
 * FurnaceUpgradeInjectionRule, TaskBuilderService) never went through the guard at all, so
 * "anywhere" coverage wasn't actually anywhere. This class fixes both: one settle delay before the
 * first check, a bounded retry (tap Cancel, re-check, tap again if it's somehow still up), and
 * every Back call site below now routes through here.</p>
 *
 * <p>The guard used to swallow a definitively-stuck dialog as a logged
 * warning and return normally, letting every caller above proceed as if nothing happened -- into
 * a screen that may still be showing the quit confirmation. It now throws
 * {@link QuitDialogStuckException} in that case (see {@link #dismissIfPresent(EmulatorController,
 * String)}), which {@code TaskQueue.routeError} catches the same way it already catches
 * {@code HomeNotFoundException} -- re-running INITIALIZE to recover to a known screen instead of
 * silently continuing blind. And the actual decision logic (settle → probe → tap → re-probe →
 * give up) is now the package-private {@link #dismissIfPresent(String, Function, Runnable,
 * LongConsumer)} overload: a pure seam over "locate the dialog" / "tap Cancel" / "sleep", with no
 * {@link EmulatorController} or ADB call in it, so {@code QuitDialogGuardTest} can drive every
 * outcome (absent, delayed, dismissed-first-attempt, still-stuck, interrupted mid-guard) with fake
 * lambdas instead of a live emulator.</p>
