# Close-cross detection

`CloseCrossDetector` is a reusable vision primitive for locating light X-shaped
close controls. Callers select a predefined screen region or pass an explicit
inclusive area. Results contain bounds, center, and score in full-frame
coordinates; the detector never taps or decides whether the current screen is
safe to dismiss.

The detector uses multi-scale grayscale OpenCV template matching. This covers
the observed light crosses across different background colors without tying the
vision module to a task or overlay lifecycle. The existing startup overlay
dismissal remains separate and retains its own narrow search, threshold, and
bounded tap attempts.

## Evidence and limits

Initialization now uses the shared detector in its measured
`(540, 65)`–`(680, 240)` area, after higher-priority startup blockers have been
checked. The lower edge was extended after a live offer's close-cross match
spanned y=145–205 and was clipped by the previous y=200 boundary. A full
upper-right quarter produced a false match on Welcome back in saved-frame tests,
so the narrower custom-area overload is used. The existing three dismissal
limit and fresh home/world postcondition remain in place. The runtime passes the
raw emulator frame directly to avoid an intermediate image conversion.

The saved-frame set contains five positive close-control crops spanning
top-right and middle-right positions and one nearby green plus negative. Earlier
source captures contained identifying account or map details; fixtures retain
only manually reviewed crops around the relevant controls. The detector and
startup integration have saved-frame tests, and annotated frames are in
`tools/close-cross-detection/evidence/`.

The initial 55% threshold is empirical for this small set. The green plus was
rejected in the saved frame, but this is not broad validation of other icon
shapes. The startup integration still needs an isolated live run and account-log
confirmation. Consumers remain responsible for their own screen-state and
action-safety decisions.
