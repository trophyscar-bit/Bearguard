# Sidebar Navigation

Whiteout Survival's August 2026 sidebar separates status and destination rows into
`City`, `Wilderness`, and `Daily`. Frostguard treats the selected section as screen-state
evidence rather than assuming that an open or tab tap succeeded.

The selected tab is classified from the fill brightness of fixed interior samples. In the
five supplied 720 x 1280 frames, the selected sample averages 165-172 while unselected
samples average 84-97. The classifier requires both a minimum brightness and a wide lead
over the next tab. It also requires the stable near-white close-handle anchor so changing
map scenery cannot masquerade as a selected tab. A missing classification is an
unknown/closed state, not permission to continue tapping.

Opening the collapsed panel retains one fixed handle area because no stable visible target
exists in the supplied open-panel frames. The tap region is restricted to the interior of the
thin arrow at `x=6..16, y=546..554`. This stays clear of both the absolute display edge, where
MuMu can discard a tap, and the expanded compact Marching panel behind the handle on World. A
trigger tap is allowed only while a Home or World anchor is present.
After the initial 400 ms settle, the navigator polls fresh frames for up to
roughly two seconds because live logs show that a successful tap can temporarily classify as
closed or unknown. If no section appears and a fresh Home or World anchor still proves the root
screen, the trigger is retried once; the second attempt is terminal. Section changes use the
same bounded polling but never repeat the tab tap from an unknown state. Scrolls and close taps
likewise require the expected panel state. The retry decision uses one captured frame for both
the selected-section check and the Home or World anchor check. If that frame already shows the
panel, no second trigger is sent.

Queue inspection opens or reuses its verified City or Wilderness section without changing the
scroll position. This avoids unconditional reset gestures and allows one logical operation to
inspect and act on the same frame.

The left City and Daily icons provide row identity. Row order, text, height, and right-side
controls do not: completed rows may disappear when `Hide after mission completion` is enabled,
and a row can expose either Go or Claim. The navigator first matches the destination icon, derives
that row's action area, and only then accepts an allowed Go or Claim pattern inside the same row.
Go has saved variants with and without the notification badge. The first scan frame must still
show the requested section before any row match or swipe. A scan that loses the selected section
or is interrupted is reported as an unavailable sidebar, never as a missing destination.

Opening the collapsed sidebar or changing its section resets the game's list to the top. A
destination scan therefore checks that initial viewport and then moves only toward the bottom in
short overlapping 120-pixel gestures. It waits two seconds for the list to settle and scans the
icon column after every gesture. An unchanged settled icon column establishes the bottom boundary.
The scan is bounded, and a destination action must close the sidebar to confirm the transition.
Lighthouse Intel is the exception: after its Daily row is validated, navigation closes the sidebar
and uses the shared Wilderness Intel shortcut opener, which confirms the Intel screen rather than
treating a closed sidebar as transition evidence. Other destinations retain their direct row-action
behavior.
Code that deliberately reuses an already-open section preserves its current position; March Queue
recovery closes and reopens Wilderness once when no visible row contains reliable queue evidence.

City destination icons use the same row-relative Go association. Research Center is migrated
through its detected Center Research icon. After the Go transition, the building's detected
Research button is preferred; the detected tutorial hand supplies a relative target only while
the onboarding overlay occludes that button.

Trek Supplies is a conditional Daily destination: it is absent after the timed reward has
already been claimed and on accounts without Dawn Academy. The claim routine treats absence as
unavailable rather than scanning the unrelated City queues. When present, the existing supply
icon identifies its row; the routine then accepts either direct claim-panel entry or Dawn Academy
entry followed by the supply counter.

Saved evidence lives under
`modules/automation/src/test/resources/navigation/sidebar-update-20260817` and
`modules/automation/src/test/resources/navigation/sidebar-dynamic-20260821`. A sanitized current
Crystal Laboratory frame lives under `sidebar-update-20260912`. It proves that Crystal Laboratory
is a Daily destination with its own stable cube icon and a row-relative Go action, replacing the
old Lancer-icon/fixed-coordinate route. The evidence covers City,
Wilderness, multiple Daily positions, notification and non-notification Go actions, Claim,
the active-tab classifier, Research Center, Arena, Pet Adventure, Land of Heroes, Life Essence,
and the dynamic shift caused by hiding completed rows. Other destinations must not be migrated
to a guessed section or reused icon without a real post-update frame.
