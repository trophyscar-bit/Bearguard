# Startup blockers

Initialization distinguishes startup blockers before attempting recovery:

- The resource-pack dialog has separate orange `Enter Game` and blue
  `Download Now` actions. Frostguard selects `Download Now` and waits up to ten
  minutes for a home/world postcondition so tasks do not run with missing
  assets.
- The English in-game `Welcome back` modal that can follow launch or resource
  download is dismissed at most once, and only when its title and concrete
  `Confirm` action both match in one fresh frame.
- Closeable promotional overlays are dismissed at most three times per
  initialization, and only when their concrete top-right close control matches
  inside the measured area `(540, 65)`–`(680, 200)`. Offer text, artwork, price, and currency are
  not used as evidence. Frostguard taps the matched control rather than sending
  a generic Back action.
- The mandatory app-update dialog is identified pattern-first from both its
  stable `Update` title and the concrete `Update` action, with the one-action
  pale-blue panel used as supporting layout evidence. Frostguard taps only the
  matched button area, then evaluates fresh frames for up to ten minutes.
- A home/world postcondition or the separate resource-download prompt continues
  automatically without an incident. An unknown follow-up receives no input;
  it yields the profile for fifteen minutes and follows the persistent generic
  failure budget rather than claiming that store authentication is required.
- A post-click Google Play redirect is operator-owned in this scope. Frostguard
  requires foreground package `com.android.vending` after capturing a fresh
  post-click frame, independently of Store language or subpage. It creates one deduplicated
  `ACTION REQUIRED` incident, sends no Store input, stops the blocked game
  process, releases the emulator slot, and retries after one hour. Merely seeing
  the original in-game update dialog is not enough to create an incident.
- An unknown blocker first receives ten passive checks. If Whiteout Survival
  still owns the Android foreground window, Frostguard sends Android Back once
  and then reuses only verified startup handlers while requiring a fresh
  home/world postcondition. This covers stacked game-owned event and promotional
  overlays without depending on every rotating close icon. If the game is not
  foreground or home/world remains unavailable, no further input is sent. The
  profile-wide cooldown stops only the game,
  releases the slot for fifteen minutes, and never cycles the emulator or
  immediately retries Initialize.

The generic `CloseCrossDetector` handles close controls in initialization,
restricted to the measured `(540, 65)`–`(680, 200)` area. A full upper-right
quarter produced a false match on the Welcome back dialog in saved-frame tests,
so initialization uses the detector's custom-area overload. It runs only after reconnect,
resource-download, Welcome-back, and mandatory-update classification,
preserving those higher-priority flows. Its shared template is covered by the
redacted startup frame
`modules/tasks/src/test/resources/startup/closeable-offer-overlay-20260821.png`.

The measured mandatory-update title and button templates are
`mandatoryUpdateTitle.png` and `mandatoryUpdateButton.png`, cropped from the
real regression frame
`modules/tasks/src/test/resources/startup/mandatory-update-dialog-20260820.png`.
The current fix deliberately contains no Store-language OCR, Store button
template, localized Store full-frame fixture, or Store-subpage geometry. The
sign-in, app-detail, and Play Pass variants are retained only as external issue
evidence for future Store automation. The existing resource-download fixture
and flow remain separate.

A terminal blocker saves one PNG under `logs/snapshot/initialize/` before the
game process is stopped. The filename is a UTC timestamp and a type such as
`initialize-blocked`, `play-store-redirect`, `resource-download-timeout`, or
`update-follow-up`.
The terminal log line and copied incident diagnostics both carry the
workspace-relative path. The saved frame is the last decision frame, or one
fresh capture marked best-effort when that frame is missing. Passive checks
and startup states that recover do not save a frame. The shared store keeps
the 20 newest captures of each activity, so an Initialize capture is not
deleted when another task such as Bear saves one, and the reverse is also true.
When the global setting `DESKTOP_SNAPSHOT_ENABLED_BOOL` is on, the same event
also saves one desktop image under activity `desktop` and the same type.
The checkbox is off by default. Windows and X11 use `Robot` across every
attached screen. Wayland asks the session-bus screenshot portal with
`interactive` false and does not fall back to `Robot`. macOS uses the `Robot`
path and is not tested. A failed desktop capture does not cancel the emulator
frame or the cooldown.
These PNGs stay on disk unredacted and are never uploaded. Before sharing
one, review it and run the privacy redactor from `tools/privacy-redactor`
when that tool covers the visible text.

`ProfileCooldownException` is reusable by other tasks after their own bounded
recovery is exhausted. A supplied action-required context escalates
immediately; a context-free cooldown contributes to the generic persistent
failure budget. The queue keeps the requested next run, force-stops only the
game process, releases the emulator slot, and reacquires it before resuming. If
slot release fails, it retains lease ownership instead of acquiring a second
slot.
